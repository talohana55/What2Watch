# What2Watch
## A full-scale fullstack school project, a series & movies viewing & reviewing platform created based on the TMDB api.

## General Information
This project is a platform wherein users can view, favorite and review popular new media being published online. 
The site uses the TMDB api to display the newest from the entertainment world, and users the site can add the content to their watchlists and even leave a review. 

This was my group's project for the course "Software Project Management" that included a fullstack approach to coding, as well as 
extensive documentation in the form of SPMP documents and Hackathon synopsis.
 The tasks were tracked using Jira, a Jenkins pipeline is set up to automate CICD, and the site was later uploaded to Heroku as an added challenge.

## Technologies:
* React, NodeJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS.

## Launch: 
The best way to use the site is to go to https://w2w-front.herokuapp.com/
however, should you choose to run it locally:
Install the dependencies using "npm install" for both the client & server directories.
afterwards, navigate 2 cmds to the client and to the server directories respectively.
run "npm run dev" in each of the directories, if all was configured well (and based on what version of the project you're using) both the backend and
the frontend should boot up.
navigate the site!

## Project status: 
No longer being worked on. The final state of the project is far from perfect, however the majority of the lessons to be learned from it have been achieved, and therefore
I have moved on to other projects.

## Acknowledgements
This was part of my "Software Project Management" course, and as such I must thank my lecturer Ms. Hadas Chassidim.
